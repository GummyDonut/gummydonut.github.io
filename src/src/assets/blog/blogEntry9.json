	"text": "Well a month has past for the summer time, and its time to think what I have done. \nI'm starting to feel comfortable at work my other part time job has been very accommodating.\nI have been making time for myself and one of the major focuses was to simply get in the groove.\nWork has been grooved in. However, I need to somehow fit in time for workouts I struggle and I start getting lazy.\nNormally I would look for a more gamified way to get me active, but most of them lack the \"game\" element. Thus I'm\nseriously considering making a full fledged pedometer game for my side project. It's either that or a web-tool, maybe speedrunning\nbut much Ideas...\n\nP.S This is for future Peter if you read this again. Please stop playing StarCraft you get nothing from it.\n",
