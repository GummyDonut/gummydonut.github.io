Since I made any changes to this actual blog, and he in ALL ways is correct.... Just lately I have been too lazy or completely outright stocked with nothing to do.....I honestly have no excuses right? \n \n..... School? \n \n Meh maybe but not really.... \n \n Work?.....Kinda \n \n Extracurriculars .....? \n\n Sort of. More than anything else this is a reminder to me that I have to complete tasks that I set out to do, update theresume section and the styling.....Dammit Peter why you no do thing!!"
