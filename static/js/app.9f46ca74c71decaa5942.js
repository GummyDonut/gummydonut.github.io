webpackJsonp([0],{"4OlF":function(e,t){e.exports={text:'So it\'s been about two years since the last post made (minus the test post). A lot has occurred since then.I have been spending a lot more time with self-reflection and realized that competition although rewarding and challenging. Taken to an extreme has been very bad for my mental health. Competition to such an extreme has such large diminishing returns initially its great however as you go farther deeper in, the negatives start outwaying the positives. For coding, constantly coding and studying lead to burnout. For Gaming it lead to a significant wrist injury which still pains me today.Thus for this year, competition will no longer be a main focus but more of a tertiary item. Instead it will just be simplybe self-improvement. Pushing myself lead me to have massive burnout. Burnout that resulted in me doing nothing for a straight four months. It was only until I picked up my 3D origami hobby again where I took improvement at a slower, more enjoyable pace that I wanted to relearn again. Lesson for this year! It\'s not a sprint, it\'s a marathon... I life long one.\n<h4>Completed Projects</h4>Completed projects this year were done at the last quarter of the year. Rebounding from the burnout, I began applying the VUE code I learned from work in recreating my Angular 1.0 website in VUE. That was a fun experience, relooking at two year old code and remaking it. I\'ve started a new youtube channel for displaying my 3D origami <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKTq9yNdW1a2wmElAeZ-PgA">creations</a> here you can see some of the cool stuff made. Through talking with a few people I have become a moderator for a 3d origami <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldenVentureFolding/">subreddit</a>. Finally I started the process of losing weight this month, 5 pounds down already. A good start and hopefully lead to something more.\n<h4>Plans for Next Year</h4>Plans for next year, with the burnout recently doused with water(Can you douse a burnout with water?). I have two new projects plan related to 3d origami subreddit, I will be creating an <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lantern77/3d-origami-diagram-tool">editing tool</a> for creating 3d origami diagram. In addition, I will be learning React to expand my repertoire. I will be learning it to create a darkest dungeon tool to help make my game experience more enjoyable. The year has been through a large and slow down. But by the end it reached a very large and hopeful peak. I learned my limitations and what is needed to push me forward. Hopefully this is the start of brand new thing.\n\nRegards Peter.\nP.S I hopefully should write a tutorial for VUE and hopefully this goes through my CMS well!!!',title:"A New Year",thumbnail:"img/thumbnail/ZW45ylGvDU29aNp8qwaMRgZjgq5KFZHi6RzH4q3FQ7y8qV5pMbKbmlBOnRmxa665uANM=w300.png",date:"January 1, 2019",tags:"New, Year, Hope, Burnout",id:"blogEntry13"}},B7oe:function(e,t){e.exports={id:"blogEntry3",title:"Slowly moving over to UNIX,got over fever",thumbnail:"img/thumbnail/Logo_ubuntu.png",date:"Dec 28,2014",link:"https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/14.10",linkText:"Thing I learned today, Install Ruby and Rails",text:"I finally got over this fever, started to install ruby and Ruby on Rails on my unix development (ubuntu). \n Found out the google hanouts, always requires some form of attachement Google."}},"D/sK":function(e,t){},"FE/G":function(e,t){},FiQS:function(e,t){e.exports={id:"blogEntry4",title:"Ruby on rails Dev started",thumbnail:"img/thumbnail/rails-logo.jpg",date:"Dec 29,2014",link:"http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html",linkText:"Basic Ruby on Rails Controller and View Routing",text:"Started development with rails and ran into multiple issues such as rails routing and asset piping luckly it was solved. \n Simply place in assets in the app/assests and their respective file type, images, javascript and stylesheets, and finallly routing.

It just seems more genuine and in the moment.\n\n\tThis time however, the main focus is on the 2014 -2015 summer and university school year much has happened. Let’s first get the lay down of the major events, I can think on the top of my head right now. \n\t\nI got my first ever software development job - although part time it was probably one of the biggest mind set changes.\nCame back to school and was assigned the role of vp external and head delegate for McMaster’s software engineering club.\nThe creation, more like participation of the McMaster’s new hack-a-thon group, HackitMac.\nThe job application process, pressure, much, much pressure. CUSEC preparation on a whole and the event itself. Much perspective. Finally landing the full 16 month coop.\n\n\tI would like to go in detail about each but that would drag on forever now that I think about it…..Yup I am not gonna edit that out or delete. I already spoke it….. But I can definitely expand on it a bit.\n\n\tMore than anything else this year has been one of the largest rollercoasters ever. From being straight on full job hunt mode to extracurriculars participation. I would definitely say that out of the years of my life this has been my most active. With every event related to actual software and programming I was there ready to learn. Ready to get new things in my head to prepare my self for the future. That was definitely one of the strong points of the year. In addition, with so much activity came the dawn of new friendships. By making the preparations for CUSEC for McMaster students, I made alot more friends. Especially with the Fourth years and graduate students. They also helped me and provided insight to what I should be looking out for very thoughtful...Wait… That was a bad way to end that sentence...meh… Oh wait also I forgot HackitMac, yo Jimmy Wang and Ocean Cheung best dudes ever, hard working and truly believe in what they were doing for our school . Executives on HackitMac, they truly showed me what it meant to be underdogs in the academic world. How when you do something you truly believe will be for the better for the school then it’s worth doing.. Especially when our school needs betterment….lol\n\n\tHowever, with every reflection comes the need to reflect on the weaknesses. There are two main stickers here. How to deal with massive amounts of pressure both from work and school and my health. Well the latter is much easier to explain, simple to say is that I got fatter…...like 20 pounds fatter….yup packing in the sweets helps…...Definitely one of the larger goals for this year is to lose this gawd damn awful weight. It seriously ruins my day feeling tired every second….MUR>>>>>> Second point however is the dealing with pressure, oh and learning to say no. Probably one of the stupidest thing I did was accepting to do all ten interviews within a span of five days. It made me ill-prepared and just not ready for any of them, completely unready and sleepless. I would like to name some of the things I bombed like writing a ruby function when I should have wrote a java function, forgetting how to use JQuery after studying it for two hours, and not being able to solve a bug simply because I was too scared to ask questions, when I couldn’t hear what someone said #phoneInterviews. Truly this year one of the skills I have to learn is handling pressure. Even during CUSEC preparation, I unfortunately messed up someone’s ticket. I forgot to sign them up  and unfortunately tickets were now sold out online. Fortunately, thank gawd everything worked out, however there were weeks where I could not sleep….OH my, I even forgot with all this work my grade started to tumble Luckily I was able to pull it back for an awesome transcript at the end, but man did I make people around me feel grumpy….\n\nLesson here, work-life balance…. Don’t drink all the cranberry juice all at once, it ain’t awesome. But it sure does taste good. Better than that prune juice…..Ye Ima end it there.\n\n\nMUR\n\t\n",title:"Reflection for 2014/2015 year - thinking of success and failure"}},NHnr:function(e,t,n){"use strict";Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0});var a=n("7+uW"),i={render:function(){this.$createElement;this._self._c;return this._m(0)},staticRenderFns:[function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,n=e._self._c||t;return n("div",{staticClass:"sidebar element-thick-shadow pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-6"},[n("div",{staticClass:"header"},[n("img",{staticClass:"logo",attrs:{src:"static/img/logo.png"}}),e._v(" "),n("a",{staticStyle:{color:"#ffffff"},attrs:{href:"#/blog"}},[n("h1",{staticClass:"brand-title"},[e._v("Peter's Void")])]),e._v(" "),n("h2",{staticClass:"brand-tagline"},[e._v("Where words may mean nothing ")]),e._v(" "),n("nav",{staticClass:"nav"},[n("ul",{staticClass:"nav-list"},[n("li",{staticClass:"nav-item"},[n("a",{staticClass:"pure-button",attrs:{href:"#/about"}},[e._v("About me")])]),e._v(" "),n("li",{staticClass:"nav-item"},[n("a",{staticClass:"pure-button",attrs:{href:"#/blog"}},[e._v("Blog")])]),e._v(" "),n("li",{staticClass:"nav-item"},[n("a",{staticClass:"pure-button",attrs:{"ng-href":"#/resume",href:"#/resume"}},[e._v("Resume")])])]),e._v(" "),n("br"),e._v("\r\n                -----------------\r\n                "),n("p",[e._v("\r\n                  © Test 2018 Designed By Peter Hoang Using\r\n                  "),n("a",{attrs:{target:"blank",href:"https://vuejs.org/"}},[e._v("\r\n                    VueJS\r\n                  ")]),e._v(" and "),n("a",{attrs:{target:"blank",href:"http://purecss.io/"}},[e._v("PureCSS")]),e._v(" framework")])])])])}]};var o={name:"App",components:{"lantern-navbar":n("VU/8")({name:"lantern77-navbar"},i,!1,function(e){n("D/sK")},"data-v-18396e02",null).exports}},s={render:function(){var e=this.$createElement,t=this._self._c||e;return t("div",{attrs:{id:"app"}},[t("div",{staticClass:"pure-g",attrs:{id:"layout"}},[t("lantern-navbar"),this._v(" "),t("div",{staticClass:"content pure-u-1 pure-u-md-5-6"},[t("router-view")],1)],1)])},staticRenderFns:[]};var r=n("VU/8")(o,s,!1,function(e){n("sSbD")},null,null).exports,l=n("/ocq"),h={render:function(){this.$createElement;this._self._c;return this._m(0)},staticRenderFns:[function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,n=e._self._c||t;return n("div",{staticClass:"center-align about"},[n("br"),e._v(" "),n("br"),e._v(" "),n("div",{staticClass:"about-section element-shadow",staticStyle:{width:"auto",display:"inline-block"}},[n("h1",{staticStyle:{"margin-top":"0em"}},[e._v("Peter Hoang")]),e._v(" "),n("img",{staticClass:"profile-img",attrs:{src:"static/img/logo.png"}}),e._v(" "),n("br"),e._v(" "),n("p",{staticStyle:{"text-align":"center",margin:"0"}},[e._v("\n      December 07 1994\n    ")]),e._v(" "),n("hr",{staticStyle:{width:"45%"}}),e._v(" "),n("small",[e._v("\n      peter_hoang2@hotmail.com\n    ")]),e._v(" "),n("br"),e._v(" "),n("small",[e._v("\n    Software Developer and Hobbyist\n    ")])]),e._v(" "),n("br"),e._v(" "),n("br"),e._v(" "),n("br"),e._v(" "),n("div",{staticClass:"pure-g about-section element-shadow"},[n("div",{staticClass:"pure-u-1 pure-u-md-3-4",staticStyle:{"text-align":"left"}},[n("h1",[e._v("Oha!

months ago I ran into the issue of wishing to inject html or embedded elements into my blogging system.  The was an issue as the CMS (Content Management System) parsed everything as text.\n<img src = '/static/img/thumbnail/cms.png' width='200' height = '200'></img>\nYes.. That is my CMS it looks like it's still stuck in the 90's but THIS IS MY CHALLENGE build everything strictly from hard-code and use api's that are only relevant to building a front-end website. Back-end logic is to be handled all by myself.\nBack to the original problem. Here are the links I started off with originally to fix this string sanitization issue.\n<a href='http://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/archive/2014/09/10/a-journey-with-trusted-html-in-angularjs.aspx'>Ode to Code</a>\n<a href ='http://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/archive/2014/09/10/a-journey-with-trusted-html-in-angularjs.aspx'>Stack Overflow1</a>\n<a href='http://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/archive/2014/09/10/a-journey-with-trusted-html-in-angularjs.aspx'>Stack Overflow 2</a>\nWhat originally was the issue was that when creating ths JSON storage file for all my blogs. I used Java's (yes I wanted to learn a bit of JAVA EE dev for my work) JSONObject.put methods. However, this lead to the issue of JSONOBJect treating every input as a string literal. SO I scrapped it and created my own parser. It was not hard.\n<code> String mainBlogText = this.blogEntryVar.replaceAll('(\\\\r|\\\\n|\\\\r\\\\n)+', '\\\\\\\\n').replaceAll('\\'', ''');\n\t\t\n\t\tString blogEntryJSON = '{ \n';\n\t\tblogEntryJSON += '\\'title\\': \\'' + this.titleVar  + '\\',\n';\n\t\tblogEntryJSON += '\\'date\\': \\'' + this.dateVar  + '\\',\n';\n\t\tblogEntryJSON += '\\'text\\': \\'' + mainBlogText  + '\\',\n';\n\t\tblogEntryJSON += '\\'thumbnail\\': \\'' + this.locateVar  + '\\',\n';\n\t\tblogEntryJSON += '\\'link\\': \\'' + this.linkVar  + '\\',\n';\n\t\tblogEntryJSON += '\\'linkText\\': \\'' + this.linkNameVar  + '\\' \n';\n\t\t\n\t\tblogEntryJSON += '}';</code>\nOne the string was created it was sent into a file writer and outputted into a file that was later parsed by angular. However, that was where I ran into the problem of runnning into Angular's sanitization. It too by default did not allow for html tag injection. This of  course is due to the simplicity of XSS attacks if allowed and a slew of JS based problems.\nHowever, angular does come with a solution <b>ngSantize</b> and <b>ng-bind-html</b>, this is particularly great as I did not have to scrap the templating framework I built from using angular MVC framework. But it also prevented JS injections as well.\nHere's how it works:\nAdd ngSanitze to index.html\n<code>&lt;script src='angular-sanitize.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>\nor use the online url version\nonce added go into your app code and add\n<code> var myApp = angular.module('App1', ['ngSanitize'])</code> \nalso in your controller add\n<code>myApp.controller('Ctrl', ['$scope','$sce', function($scope,$sce){</code>\nThe $sce will allow you to call a trustHTML function that parses out evil tags\n<code>$sce.data = $sce.trustAsHtml(data)</code>\nafter that finally add the ng-bind-html call to your html template file that is connected to your controller.\n<code>&lt;p ng-bind-html='myHTML'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>\nTHAT'S it literrally as I write this, this code was implemented yesterday and when I hope that when I click the send button in my cms that it will actually appear in properly with the html injections I performed. This is brand new frontier, with me testing out new things. Here goes to brand new school year\nUpdate:Code looks pretty ugly....on this website gotta update it ><",thumbnail:"img/thumbnail/angular.jpg",link:"",linkText:""}},QyKY:function(e,t){},R893:function(e,t){},Wsxo:function(e,t){e.exports={id:"blogEntry10",date:"August, 08, 2016",thumbnail:"img/thumbnail/Seclogo.jpg",link:"https://www.airpair.com/javascript/posts/the-legend-of-canvas",linkText:"legend of Canvas",text:"Completely and totally inspired by an article posted on Airpair. I finally mastered or at least got a hold of my coding habits. About three months ago I promised to myself that I would spend more time coding and less time playing video games…. Yes I’m talking about you starcraft.\n\nHowever it became a mountain of excuses. Especially when it comes to managing two jobs. One full-time and the other free-lance. My free-time became filled with, “I deserve a break,  I gotta take a breather from coding”. But this was a poisonous mindset, I had to make coding part of my life not ‘work’. Something that I could clearly eat up everyday and still not get tired as software is constantly updating I still have to keep myself relevant and up-to-date. That happened, today and I realised it only now. Here’s how it went down and the requirements that I needed to feel this way.\n“Live to Code… Not Code to Live”.\n\nThe biggest change was that I took some spare time to build same basic building block in my technical arsenal. This was probably the biggest of all the hurdles. There was alot of painful frustration as I learned the basic theories of my trade in order to be fully confident when faced with new tasks. Before this when an new idea came up in my head, fear would ensue in the sense that I could not come up with the basic ideas of how to implement the solution. Now, I still don’t. However, I have the confidence that I can build the basic structures required to take on any challenge.\n\nSecond, still take some breaks. Once a day I will play a few games. Especially now that I got my self hooked onto Heroes of the Storm. A much quicker and more fulfilling game than StarCraft. Human interaction is GREAT.\n\nThird, friends that you can actually show off your work to. Probably one of my most driving forces here is the ability to show of your work. Bragging does feel good. Of course limit your big head, but when you have done something awesome keeping it to yourself can make you feel quite lonely and depressed.\n\nFinally, the final trigger that got me into the mood of coding after hours was a dedicated environment. A place with no distractions, a place where it conditions you to say this is the place where I code and nothing else. Prior to this I would code in the living filled with noises that did not pertain to me and exhaust my mindset, also the noise also just made me want to play more games. Essentially everyone else was having fun while I looked like I was doing work. Now my setup is a ironing board(mind you its adjustable so it great for a stand up sitting table as well) with one external monitor(for twitch streams to keep me from being depressed) and a laptop the environment in which I code.\n\n\nWith this now I can finally start coding. Also one thing always make something you love… Hence I combined that with video games and hopefully great ideas will come soon..\n\nRegards to the void\n",title:"Mastering of the extracurriculars"}},"Y+mk":function(e,t){},Y2v5:function(e,t){e.exports={id:"blogEntry1",title:"Mehh Updates",thumbnail:"img/github_icon.png",date:"Sept 23,2014",link:"https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=194376656",linkText:"Arka Ganguli",text:"It was brought to my attention, by my friend Arka Ganguli, that I have failed to update in quite a whiles time.
